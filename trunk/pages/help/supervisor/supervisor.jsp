<strong>Managing your research group personnel data</strong><br>
When you want to manage your research group personnel data, you will see a screen like the one below. The main concepts of the application are as follows:<br>
<br/>
<center><img src="<%=JspUtils.getProjectPath(request)%>/images/help/supervisor.jpg" width="700" height="395" border="1">
</center>
<br>
  
In the main screen you will see a list of all of your research group members whose data has not been completed and approved ("send to progress"). By clicking at the tabs <img src="<%=JspUtils.getProjectPath(request)%>/images/gui/tag_1.gif" width="24" height="13"> you can navigate through the lists of your research group members at different stages of validation: those you have not yet validated (pending), those you have already validated (in progress), and those you have cancelled (cancelled). <img src="<%=JspUtils.getProjectPath(request)%>/images/gui/tag_2.gif" width="24" height="13"> lists the group members at each stage. Select a group member, and use the buttons in <img src="<%=JspUtils.getProjectPath(request)%>/images/gui/tag_3.gif" width="24" height="13"> to take the desired action.<br/>
<br><strong>Procedure</strong><br>
Every time a new member in your group creates a database entry, you will receive notification by email. This group member will automatically be added to your &quot;pending&quot; list. Please the complete and approve the information and submit (send to progress).<br/>
<br><strong>Complete the data for your group members</strong><br/>
To add data to a group member´s entry, please select the group member and click on the modify button. A form will appear which you should fill in and save by clicking on the save button (note that "save" does not submit the form - this must be done in a subsequent step). Next, click on the "funding details" tab, and add new funding information for the group member. You may add as many funding entries as needed.<br/>
<br><strong>Sending the data to progress (submitting).</strong><br>
Once you have introduced all the data for a group member, please submit the information by selecting the group member in the pending list and clicking on "send to progress". If information is missing you will see a warning message with instructions.<br/>
